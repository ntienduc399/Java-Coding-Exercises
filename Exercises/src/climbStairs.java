/*
Doraemon wants to climb a staircase with n steps. He can move up either 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Doraemon wants the number of moves to be a multiple of an integer m. What is the minimum number of moves
that will allow him to reach the top of the staircase and satisfy his condition?

Hint: Find the minimum number of moves (x = n // 2) needed to reach the top of the staircase and
the maximum number of moves (y = n) required to reach the n steps. The problem reduces to finding
the smallest number >= x and <= y that is divisible by m. You can use the formula (x + m - 1) // m * m
to quickly find the result and then compare it with y.

Input Format:
A single line containing two integers, n and m, separated by a space.

Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 10^9
Output Format:
Print a single integer â€” the minimum number of moves that is a multiple of m. If there is no way to climb the staircase satisfying the condition, print -1.
